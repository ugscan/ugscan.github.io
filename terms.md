Terms of Use
=========================

By installing and using UGScan or UGStudio, you agree to be bound by the following Terms of Use. Please read these terms carefully. These terms apply to all free and professional version users.

### Free Features
We offer free features that allow you to scan and view results. If you require professional features such as sharing scan data or using advanced scanning, you will need to purchase a subscription upgrade to the professional version.

### Subscription
Some features of this application require a paid subscription. If you require these features, you must purchase a subscription to become a professional user. You will make payments for a fixed period, with payment periods available on a monthly or annual basis.
At the end of each subscription period, your subscription will automatically renew according to the subscription item you selected. If the renewal is successful, the subscription authorization will automatically be extended for the same period, unless you cancel the subscription authorization.
You can cancel automatic subscription renewal at any time (up to 24 hours before the current period ends) by accessing the subscription management page in your Apple account.

### UGScan and UGStudio
UGStudio is an extension of UGScan that compensates for insufficient phone memory and computing power. Only professional users can use the data synchronization function. If you need to synchronize scans from UGScan to Studio, you will need to upgrade to the professional version.

### Pricing
We may modify subscription prices in the future. Any changes to subscription prices will take effect after the current period ends.
If the price of the subscription item you subscribed to changes, you will be notified before automatic renewal. You can choose to continue or cancel it.
If you choose to continue the subscription after the price change takes effect, you agree to the modified price.

### Refunds
Refunds will comply with Apple's subscription refund policy. To request a refund, please contact Apple's official customer support.

### Accounts
UGScan and UGStudio do not retain your account. For personal privacy information, please refer to our privacy policy.
If you change your Apple ID, it may result in the invalidation of your subscription authorization. Please cancel the previous subscription account and subscribe again with the new Apple ID to become a professional user.

### Safety
Please be aware of the surrounding safety environment when using UGScan for scanning. Individuals shall bear corresponding responsibilities for any accidents that may occur.
